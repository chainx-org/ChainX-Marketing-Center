## Why set up the Marketing Center?

ChainX's first halving was successfully completed on June 5th, meaning the PolkaX development team will no longer enjoy any computing power incentives. The percentage of computing power before PolkaX's halving is allocated to the user's staking income. After the halving, the PolkaX team will be employed in the council to serve the development and maintenance of ChainX. Before the halving, the operation of ChainX was undertaken by the council, part of it was shared by PolkaX. After the halving, ChainX needs a more professional and dedicated operation team to lead ChainX to the next milestone. Therefore, the Parliament decided to form the Marketing Center to assume this responsibility.
